# Titanic_data_analysis
We will use various data preprocessing techniques to analyze the titanic dataset and build a decision tree model. This is just for practice purpose for for dealing with a classification problem.

Predicting Survival in the Titanic Data Set
We will be using a decision tree to make predictions about the Titanic data
set from Kaggle. This data set provides information on the Titanic
passengers and can be used to predict whether a passenger survived or
not.
